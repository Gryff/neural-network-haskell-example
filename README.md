# Neural network haskell example
A very simple example of the simplest neural network, in Haskell

The network consists of one input neuron and one output neuron, no hidden layers.

### SimplestNetwork.hs
It solves `y = mx`, where the line must pass through the origin (no bias).

### SimplestBiasNetwork.hs
It solves `y = mx + c`.
